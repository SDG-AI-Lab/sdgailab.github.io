          “I come from the Northwest region of Cameroon which has been affected
          by a bloody and deadly civil war since 2016. Thousands have lost their
          lives. Many have fled their homes to neighbouring cities and
          countries. I have lost a few friends and have seen schools and
          hospitals burned to the ground. I understand first-hand what it means
          to live in seemingly never-ending fear and suffering. This experience,
          however, made me hopeful for the use of digital technologies in
          crises.
        </p>
        The SDG AI Lab shares the same passion and beliefs that I have held in
        my heart for many years – to harness the potential of Artificial
        Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing to
        promote peace and strengthen actions towards climate control, human
        rights, education, the eradication of poverty and diseases."

          In the pursuit of a better and more sustainable world, data scientists
          have their unique roles and responsibilities. As a word of
          encouragement and caution for fellow data scientists and future
          applicants, Mert Atay, SDG AI Lab Data Science Fellow said: “I would
          suggest that their learning should not be limited to technical
          subjects and they should seek ways to improve their communication and
          collaboration skills as well. In this regard, they should not be
          hesitant to face challenges. We are all humans after all and even
          though we build automated digital solutions, their motivation and
          implications are inevitably affected by us, people. They should be
          responsible and open-minded towards these topics and do their best for
          a better future and a better world.”
