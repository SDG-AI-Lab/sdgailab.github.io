        Frontier Tech Leaders Programme is a capacity-building program dedicated
        to empowering youth in LDCs, especially women, to harness the potential
        of frontier technologies.
        <br /> <br />
        Our mission is to bridge the digital divide, build local tech and
        entrepreneurial capacities, and inspire young individuals to contribute
        to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.

        The Frontier Tech Leaders Program (FTL) Programme aims to improve access
        to inclusive & quality training on frontier technologies in the Least
        Developed Countries (LDC). For that, FTL Programme will provide bootcamp
        style certificated training in frontier technologies. The FTL will also
        train LDC government officials to strengthen government’s capacities to
        adopt technologies in their day-to-day work. This program aims to
        achieve youth upskilling consistent with the job market demands. The
        Program participants will receive training on entrepreneurship and
        mentorship from tech companies. The FTL Programme will also run a
        Virtual Digital Business Incubation (VDBI) Programme to provide
        incubation support to participants to develop their own digital business
        ideas.
        <br /> <br />
        The FTL will support the development of innovative goods, tech startups
        and jobs in the LDCs. The FTL will establish partnerships with the
        private sector, international organizations, foundations, and academia.
        The support of the partners will complement the base offer on training,
        community, and business incubation. Through partnerships the Programme
        will mobilize additional resources to expand its geography and
        activities.
        <br /> <br />
        The recent cohort includes participants from 14 different countries:
        Afghanistan, Angola, Benin, Burkina Faso, Chad, Djibouti, Ethiopia,
        Guinea, Niger, Sierra Leone, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and Yemen.

        SDG AI Lab Data Science Fellowship programme aims to support young data
        scientists in becoming professionals, who will drive inclusive digital
        transformation in their communities and actively contribute to the
        achievement of the SDGs
        <br />
        SDG AI Lab will mobilize Data Science Fellows to unleash their potential
        to become new role models inspiring young people while supporting their
        professional and personal development. They will work under UNDP ICPSD’s
        SDG AI Lab supervision and contribute to the Lab’s work in digital
        solutions development and research.

        The fellowship also effectively addresses the industry gender
        stereotypes and get young women excited about data science and
        prospective careers by positioning the Data Fellows as relatable role
        models. To expand the benefits of the programme, SDG AI Lab plans to
        engage private sector partners, including global tech companies.
        <br /> <br />
        For the program duration, SDG AI Lab would invest in the fellows’ talent
        via comprehensive and advanced training, research management, mentoring,
        and coaching. Fellows would be better equipped to develop and deliver
        digital solutions and advance in their future careers in tech and data
        science. They will have a chance to apply their knowledge to address
        various development issues such as poverty, gender inequality, disaster
        response, and others by joining the SDG AI Lab's ongoing efforts
        <br /> <br />
        The initiative envisions outreach activities such as webinars,
        interviews, podcasts, and others to spotlight the fellows and their

        The Volunteer Data Scientists Initiative connects UNDP teams and online
        volunteer data scientists to find solutions in addressing development
        challenges such as Covid-19, disaster response, poverty, climate change
        and others.
        <br />
        The volunteers in the SDG AI Lab play a crucial role in advancing the
        Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through digital transformation.
        Both on-site UN Volunteers and their online counterparts are at the
        forefront of leveraging big data and artificial intelligence to tackle
        the multifaceted challenges posed by the 2030 Agenda.

        The initiative has engaged over 100 online volunteers from 40+ countries
        in various digital projects. Volunteer Data Scientists Initiative has
        been recognized as one of the best UN (United Nations) Volunteers
        Practices for online volunteers’ engagement.
        <br />
        <br />
        The Volunteers bring diverse expertise, specializing in machine learning
        and AI, and collaborate on projects that range from analyzing social
        media data during crises to improving the operational efficiency of UNDP
        programs. Online volunteers, in particular, work within agile
        frameworks, collaborating in small teams, and employ advanced
        technologies to coordinate their efforts. These dedicated individuals
        have shown that digital volunteerism is not just a response to the
        COVID-19 pandemic but a long-term solution to address global challenges.
        Their contribution extends beyond geographical limitations, fostering
        international collaboration and building a network of professionals who
        are deeply committed to serving the UN's mission and the betterment of
        society.
        <br />
        <br />
        In essence, volunteers are instrumental in driving innovation and
        progress towards the SDGs, demonstrating the power of digital
        collaboration for a more sustainable and inclusive future.
